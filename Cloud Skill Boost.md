# Google Cloud Skill Boost

`Data` is the foundation of every application integrated with `AI`

Without `Data`, there is nothing for `AI` to learn from, no pattern to recognize and no insight to gain.

Without `AI`, large amount of data can be unmanageable or underutilized.

Google has 9 products that process lots of data every day.
1. Android
2. Chrome
3. G Mail
4. Google Drive
5. Google Maps
6. Google Search
7. Google Play Store
8. YouTube
9. Google Photos

To meet the needs of a growing user base, Google has developed the infrastructure to `ingest`, `manages` and `serve` high quantites of data from the applications.

`AI` and `ML` have been integrated into these products to make the user experience of each even more productive.

`Google Cloud` offerings can be broadly categorized as `Compute`, `Storage`, `Big Data` and `Machine Learning` services for `web`, `mobile`, `analytics` and backend solutions.

### Google Cloud Infrastructure

1. Big Data & ML Products (Ingest, Store, Process and deliver business insights, data pipelines and ML models)
2. Compute & Storage 
3. Networking & Security

Organizations with growing data needs often require lots of compute power to run big data jobs.
